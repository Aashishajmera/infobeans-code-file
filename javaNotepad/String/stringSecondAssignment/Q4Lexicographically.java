// 4. Write a Java program to compare two strings lexicographically Two strings are lexicographically equal if they are the same length and contain the same characters in the same positions

class Q4Lexicographically{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Aashish";
        String s2 = "aashis";

        for(int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++){
            
        }
